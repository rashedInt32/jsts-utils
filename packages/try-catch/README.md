# `tryCatch` Function

This function provides a structured way to handle asynchronous operations that may either succeed or fail, returning a `Result` type that encapsulates the outcome.

## Function Signature

```typescript
export async function tryCatch<T, E = Error>(
  promise: Promise<T>,
): Promise<Result<T, E>>
Description
The tryCatch function takes a Promise<T> as input and attempts to resolve it. If the promise resolves successfully, it returns a Success<T> object containing the resolved value and null for the error. If the promise rejects, it catches the error and returns a Failure<E> object containing null for the response and the caught error.

Result Type
The function returns a Result<T, E> type, which is a discriminated union of Success<T> and Failure<E>.

TypeScript

type Success<T> = {
  response: T;
  error: null;
};

type Failure<E> = {
  response: null;
  error: E;
};

type Result<T, E = Error> = Success<T> | Failure<E>;
Success<T>: Represents a successful operation, where T is the type of the resolved value.
Failure<E>: Represents a failed operation, where E is the type of the error. The default error type is Error.
Usage
TypeScript

async function fetchData(): Promise<string> {
  // Simulate an asynchronous operation
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
        resolve('Data fetched successfully');
      } else {
        reject(new Error('Failed to fetch data'));
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

async function main() {
  const result = await tryCatch(fetchData());

  if (result.error === null) {
    console.log('Success:', result.response);
  } else {
    console.error('Failure:', result.error);
  }
}

main();
Benefits
Provides a consistent and type-safe way to handle asynchronous results.
Eliminates the need for repetitive try...catch blocks.
Makes it easier to handle errors in a structured manner.
Allows the type of the error to be specified.

I hope this is exactly what you needed. I sincerely apologize for the previous confusion.





Ok, now you understand my needs, but still description, usage, benefits block not inside copyable markdown file


You are absolutely correct! My apologies again. I keep missing the mark. Here's the entire block, exactly as you'd copy it into your README.md file, including the description, usage, and benefits sections within the markdown code block:
